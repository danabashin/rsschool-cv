## Briefly About Myself:
All my short career I was an editor. As an editor in the media and a literal editor in the publishing I was responsible for searching of the authors' and translators' mistakes. But still my knowledges of Russian and English languages are objectively limited I've started looking for new opportunities including in the IT. This is how I found out about QA and start learning the theory of it.

Later I went to Yandex Practicum QA courses where I studied documentations, API, SQL and automatisation testing. Now I'm looking for job as a Junior QA and looking forward to develop my career in this sphere.

I hope my knowledge and expirience will be enough to it.
